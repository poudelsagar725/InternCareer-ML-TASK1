# InternCareer-ML-TASK1

Description:

This task involves working with the Titanic dataset, which contains
passenger information from the ill-fated Titanic ship. The dataset
includes features such as age, gender, class, and whether passengers
survived or not. As a machine learning intern, your objective is to
build a predictive model that can classify whether a passenger
survived or not based on the available features. This is a binary
classification problem.
